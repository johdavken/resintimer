Description

Resin Timer is a lightweight, mobile-friendly, offline web app for blown film lines. Enter line rate, layer splits, hopper splits, and hopper weights to calculate time-to-empty and (optionally) “start by” times before a changeover—plus per-layer downcomer offsets. Results are sorted by the most urgent hopper and include a Pump Off checklist to track progress.

How to use (quick tutorial)
1) Open the app

  📋Download or clone this repo.

  📋Open resin-timer-0_0##.html in any modern browser (Chrome, Safari, Edge, Firefox).

  📋Works offline after it’s loaded.

2) Line setup

  Line rate (lb/hr): Enter total line output. (e.g., 1200)

  Line type: Choose 1, 3, or 5 layers.

  Percent mode: Leave on % unless you prefer fractions.

  Changeover time (optional): Set a deadline time (e.g., 4:00PM).

  If set, Results sort by Start by.

  If blank, Results sort by Time to empty.

  Downcomer offset (minutes): Enter a per-layer offset to account for downcomer run-down time.

  Offset is added to the calculated run-down time.

  For line 9, leave at 0.

3) Layer split

  Enter the % of total line rate assigned to each layer (should total 100%).

  Example (3-layer): A=20, B=60, C=20

4) Hopper splits + weights (per layer)

  For each layer:

  Enter each hopper Split (% of that layer, should total 100%).

  Enter each hopper Weight (lb) (current resin in hopper).

  Tip: faster entry using Enter:

  Split → Weight → next Split

5) Results

  Results display a single combined list, sorted by the most urgent hopper.

  Each result includes:

  Hopper rate (lb/hr)

  Time to empty

  Total time (empty + downcomer offset)

  If changeover is set: Start by time

  Check Pump off when you’ve shut that hopper’s pump off — the row fades/greys out.

6) Recipes (named configs)

  Type a Config name → click Save / Update config.

  Export copies a JSON recipe you can share.

  Import pastes a JSON recipe and can load it.
